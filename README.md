# Project Overview

#### MVP

_These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features._

- Implementing buttons that capture that value of order name, as well as order.
- Printing a receipt for the order by appending data to a 'receipt' div
- Drop down menu for customizing order

#### PostMVP

- Alternate interface where the order would be fully customizable
- Storing ingredients when supply runs low after 'x' amount of coffee/donuts has been sold.

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
